# ExampleLoader - C#
Hi! ExampleLoader is a cheat loader written in C#.  The name says it all, this is just an **example**. 
Do not expect any sort of anti-leak features for injection. 
This is mostly a demonstration of the awesome stuff you can do with CefSharp. 


## Features
* Manual Map injection
* PHP Login API
* HWID System
* Product Selection (hardcoded)
* Remember me
* Clean design
* Animations
* ParticleJS background

## Information

This loader features a clean design made possible by CefSharp. CefSharp lets us use an embed Chromium Browser. Meaning we will be able to render HTML5, use javascript and most importantly run it smoothly. 

Please note this is not a practical example of a loader, because of CefSharp this loader is far from standalone, in fact all of its dependencies will add up to a total size of over 100MB. Apart from that there also isn't any injection security implemented (as far as anti-leak), this is just an simple example of how to do a loader, but a pretty advanced example of what can be done with CefSharp. For example creating custom objects, and communicating with them through JavaScript.
